\section{Cost}

As an attempt to maintain working condition of older robots, many replacement components were purchased this year. A cost estimate of this robot is included in Table \ref{TAB:Cost}, showing the value of each of the components, how much our team paid for them, and how much of that was spent this year. In total, Misti is worth approximately \$19000, with our team spending approximately \$9640 this year.
