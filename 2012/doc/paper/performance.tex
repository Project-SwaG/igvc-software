\section{Performance}

Previous testing of our vision and control algorithms have shown that they are capable of avoiding obsticals and navigating switchbacks and we are confident that the software will continue to perform as well as it has in the past.

Using the camera, objects come into view at a distance of 2 m. The LIDAR allows objects to be sensed reliably at up to 5 m. The robot will typically begin to take action at a distance of 1 m - 2 m. The main planning and execution loop runs at approximately 3 Hz.

With the changes to the path planning software, the robot should be better able to navigate the unstructured part of the course given GPS waypoints as goals and obstacles from vision. Open loop testing of the new algorithms as well as limited control testing of the new software gives us reasonable confidences that our changes will allow us to perform well at the upcoming competition.
