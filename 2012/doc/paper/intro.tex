%stuff about club and teams
RoboJackets is a robotics competition and outreach group that has been operating at the Georgia Institute of Technology since 1999. Overall the RoboJackets consist of four teams a FIRST outreach / mentorship, Middle Weight BattleBots, RoboCup Small Size and IGVC. In all members come from many of the engineering departments across campus (prominently Mechanical, Aerospace, Electrical, and Computer Science) thus providing a truly multidisciplinary robotics development experience. The RoboJackets IGVC Team initially started in 2004 has fielded a team every year except 2005. Additionally, we have attained a top ten finish in the autonomous course since 2007.
